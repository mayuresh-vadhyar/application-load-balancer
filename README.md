# Application Load Balancer

Lightweight HTTP load balancer implemented in Go. Routes incoming requests to a pool of backend servers using multiple balancing algorithms, performs health checks, and optionally enforces Redis-backed rate limiting.

**Features**
- **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, IP-hash, URL-hash.
- **Health Checks:** Periodic upstream health checks with cooldowns and restart limits.
- **Server Management API:** Register, list and remove backend servers via `/server` (GET, POST, DELETE).
- **Proxying:** Proxies requests on `/` to chosen backend and injects `tracking-id` and `X-Forwarded-Server` headers.
- **Rate Limiting (optional):** Redis-backed strategies like Fixed Window and Token Bucket (Lua script).
- **Config-driven:** Behavior controlled by `config.json`.
